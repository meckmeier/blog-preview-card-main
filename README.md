## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about centering objects on the page. Using custom colors, and ordering my workflow to build the HTML first, and add in the css after. It was a back and forth for me - but the process is becoming more clear now. I 
I am trying to use more semantic classes (saying what stuff IS rather than how it LOOKS) is tricky but it feels like it will work better when you have a larger site. As I try to lay things out though I have to add more categories, so it's been a bit of an iterative process.

```css
    main {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      height: 100vh;
    }
Trying to figure out how to center the card on the page was really difficult to me. Until I added the height: 100vh (offered by emmet in my vs environment) I could not get the vertical alignment to work. I'd love to know why that is, but for now - it works.



### Continued development

I think being able to practice this basic stuff is really key to getting better at it. I am still looking up a lot of coding as I go, but the more I do, it the less I have to look up.
